Web Scraping : Grabbing data from the web using HTMl files

Not all websites allow data scraping, so check that using:
                    [url]/robots.txt
Example:       udemy.com/robots.txt

There are both ethical and unethical way of web scraping
Ideally websites can have API, so use it before using this library
Chrome has web scrapper plug-ins to use

Beautiful Soup is the best library to use for web scraping

Ideally save the result of the project as file or html file
Also add the try except block for a delay of 30 milliseconds

There's another popular framework called scrapy with extra features

Tips:
Use Scrapy in future
Collect and store in a database
